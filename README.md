[# IOC Java 17
 

### There are four essential principles of the object-oriented programming paradigm. And these principles are :

    • The abstraction
    • The encapsulation.
    • The inheritance.
    • The polymorphism.

### **The abstraction**

    In object-oriented software, the concept of abstraction helps us create a simplified,
    but relevant view of a real-world object within the context of the problem and solution domains.

### Encapsulation
    is basically an essential property of an object. In a sense, it is a mechanism by which we hide some of the information.

### The inheritance:  

    helps us reduce the amount of code that we write to build an application.
